## Learning Goals

- *Have students engage in the
data/science research pipeline in as faithful a manner as possible while
maintaining a level suitable for novices*

    <img src="../pipeline4.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 600px;"/>

- *Contribute to the R community by developing a vignette for others to learn from
on a `fivethirtyeight` R package data set using `ggplot2` and `dplyr`*

- *Design a data journalism piece focused on effective data storytelling ideas from class*

#### Format

* Your final project will center around writing a data journalism
article that acts as both a vignette for the `fivethirtyeight` R package and is in the style of quality
data journalism.  You should focus on merging these two types when you write your group project.

    - Examples of such types of journalism can be found on:
        + <a href = "http://fivethirtyeight.com/" target = "_blank">FiveThirtyEight</a>
        + The New York Times' <a href = "http://www.nytimes.com/section/upshot" target = "_blank">The Upshot</a>
    
    - Examples of vignettes can be found at
        + <a href = "http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/rudeboybert/fivethirtyeight/blob/master/vignettes/NBA.html" target = "_blank">2015 NBA player predictions analysis using the `tidyverse`</a>
        + <a href = "https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/fivethirtyeight/vignettes/bechdel.html" target = "_blank">Bechdel analysis using the `tidyverse`</a>
        + <a href = "http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/rudeboybert/fivethirtyeight/blob/master/vignettes/trump_twitter.html" target = "_blank">Trump Twitter analysis using the `tidyverse`</a>
        + <a href = "http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/rudeboybert/fivethirtyeight/blob/master/vignettes/comics_gender.html" target = "_blank">Gender in Comic Books</a>
    
* You must flex your statistical and data science muscles you've
built so far this semester. In particular:
    + Data visualization using `ggplot2`
    + Data manipulating/wrangling using `dplyr`
* You will need to include AT LEAST two publication quality graphics produced using `ggplot2`.
* Your project also needs to include AT LEAST one instance of using `dplyr` to create a summary table to be displayed directly or for use in creating a graphic using `ggplot2`.
* When you are writing the vignette, you should be thinking about explaining ideas to someone that has little to know statistical background.  The best articles/vignettes are ones that captivate a broad audience.  
* You should carefully convey what the point of your article is throughout your vignette.  You should think about the following as you work as a team.
    + Why is this important for others to know?
    + What might someone be confused about as they read this?

## Administrative Notes

* **Submission Format**: Each group must create a single RStudio project that is shared amongst the group members and with Chester. In the same folder as the RStudio project, you will include an R Markdown file containing all R code needed and the text of your vignette as well as a knitted HTML document that shows your analysis and writing.  You'll be putting all of your documents into
a Google Drive folder on Chester's account and your specific link will be shared with you after you have decided on groups.  All your work will be centrally located here; do not email me any
files.  In the shared Google Drive folder will be a file called `final_project.Rmd`.  This is where you will put your final analysis.  You are encouraged to also create R script files to show your work as needed.
* **Project Proposal**: Submit by the beginning of class on Tuesday, March 7
    + Identify as soon as possible who the three members of your group will be.  Send me a message on Slack when you have identified who you'd like to work with.
    + You should identify what are the top three data sets you'd be interested in analyzing.
    + Identify at least two questions you'd like to answer for each data set
        - This should include what variables you will use, what types they are, and which of the 5NG would be appropriate for assisting in answering these questions.
* **Group Project Draft**: Due at the beginning of class on Tuesday, March 14
    + This should be a nearly complete version of your project.  All typos should be fixed and it should include all of the requirements of the project.  **Failure to have this completed will likely result in a failing grade for the Group Project.**  This means that your work should be entirely done so that I can review it and provide some comments on style that you can fix relatively quickly.
* **Electronic-Only Final Project Submission**: Due Thursday, March 23 at 10 AM
    + In the shared folder on Google Drive:
        + A `final_project.Rmd` file that completely reproduces your analysis.  I should have to press Knit only once to recreate the entire HTML page.
        + All necessary data files (saved as CSV files) if you needed to join with other data set(s).
    + Individually: A Google Forms survey to ensure all members of the group were active members of completing the group project.  **You will not receive a passing grade for the Group Project on an individual basis if you were not a good and supportive team member.** I will include a link to this on Slack on or before Wednesday, March 22.
    + Your project won't be considered submitted until I give you Slack confirmation that everything looks good.
* **Honor Code**: This is the equivalent of an academic term paper; all honor code rules about plagarism and citations apply.







## Electronic-Only Final Project Submission

Roughly speaking, your final project submission will have two major components:

* The actual journalism article. As to knowing the guidelines (length, format,
tone), just ask yourself: "What does a newspaper/online news story sound like?"
* A supplementary materials section that goes more in depth about the
nitty-gritty details, that one might want to spare casual readers from, but
include for people wanting to learn more.
* A `final_project.Rmd` template file is available [here](http://ismayc.github.io/teaching/soc301-f2016/slides/week-12/Final_Project.Rmd).  Please download this file to your computer and then Upload it to [the RStudio Server](http://beta.rstudio.org).
