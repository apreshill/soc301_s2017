- Advice for SOC 301 students: 

1. The first piece of advice I stress the most is notes, notes, and more notes!! When you come into a class where you are basically learning a new language (or a computer language might I say), it is not only important to do the readings but also to take notes during and post-class sessions. Through the first couple weeks of class, I would do the readings and take notes during class, but that was certainly not enough to retain the information and put it to use. It is certainly most crucial to do the reading before class, take notes in class, and then go over the slides and readings after class and take notes because it is always likely that you could've missed something or other.. and it really helps when trying to retain the new info!!

2. Actually read over the tips for success and keep them in mind throughout the course because they seriously are crucial for success in the class! Personally, I would say the really essential tips would be:

(1) Seriously taking the time to practice coding in R mostly because it's difficult to really get a feel as to what the certain functions do without actually trying it for yourself. (This also helps you to quiz yourself at the same time!)

(2) Not only asking questions to your classmates but working together on stuffâ€“especially the assignments you are stuck on! Just know you are not the only one confused/stuck/struggling because guaranteed someone is right there with you. Also never be afraid to ask Chester for help, he's awesome!

3. Make sure to take the time to complete all of your Problem Sets! They don't seem to be that crucial to your grade, but they can honestly contribute a lot especially if you don't do too well on a quiz! (And they're only based on completion, no excuses!)
