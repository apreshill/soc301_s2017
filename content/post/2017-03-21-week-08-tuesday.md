### Covered Content
- Quiz #3 individually and in groups
- Peer review another group's Group Project Draft
- Finish [Revised Group Project](../../../../group_project_outline/index.html)
  - Final revisions to your Group Project are due by 10 AM in your Google Drive folder on Thursday, March 23
  - Make sure that you have a knitted HTML document (`group_project_final.html`) and the corresponding `group_project_final.Rmd` in your group Google Drive folder

### To do for next time

- [Problem Set 8](https://goo.gl/forms/tCBFF7cuMbYgPIyb2) includes you filling out a midterm course evaluation, a peer review, and an individual review of your group project.
  - You will need to fill out the form by 4:20 PM on Thursday, March 23 to receive credit.  
  - Please be candid and up-front about ways I can improve the course after spring break.  Remember that this course will challenge you and that won't be changing after break, but if I can fix the timing or the way content is covered it is much better that I hear about that NOW and not when the class is over.
