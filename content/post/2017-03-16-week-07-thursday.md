  - You can check to see if your answers are correct on this [Google Form](https://goo.gl/forms/svhYqHPSuwOwai502)
  - The quiz will cover chapters 3, 4, and 5 of ModernDive, the corresponding DataCamp assignments, and material we have covered in class.
- I will send you a message on Slack to your group when I have provided my comments on your Group Project Draft.
  - Final revisions to your Group Project are due by 10 AM in your Google Drive folder on Thursday, March 23
- [Problem Set 8](https://goo.gl/forms/tCBFF7cuMbYgPIyb2) includes you filling out a midterm course evaluation, a peer review, and an individual review of your group project.
  - You will need to fill out the form by 4:20 PM on Thursday, March 23 to receive credit.  
  - Please be candid and up-front about ways I can improve the course after spring break.  Remember that this course will challenge you and that won't be changing after break, but if I can fix the timing or the way content is covered it is much better that I hear about that NOW and not when the class is over.
