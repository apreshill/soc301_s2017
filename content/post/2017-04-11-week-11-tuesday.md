### Covered Content
- Midterm Exam

### To do for next time

- Read over all of [Chapter 6](https://ismayc.github.io/moderndiver-book/6-sim.html) of ModernDive
- Work through LC6.1-LC6.17 in RStudio as needed
  - I'll choose some subset of these questions to make up a Problem Set
  - I'm hoping you have time in class on Thursday to talk about your responses to these Learning Checks with partners after I lecture on the content covered in the remainder of Chapter 6.  Lecture will go much more smoothly if you have done the reading BEFORE class though.
