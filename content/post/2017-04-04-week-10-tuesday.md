### To do for next time

- [Problem Set 9](http://ismayc.github.io/soc301_s2017/problem-sets/index.html#ps9)

  - You should skip Problem 4 on Exam 2 as we will be covering that content later in our course.
  - Note that Exam 1 last semester was a Take Home Exam so the questions are a little more challenging at times than what I would ask you for an in-class exam.

  - The exam will cover Chapters 3, 4, and 5 and Section 6.1 of [ModernDive](http://moderndive.com) and the content covered on the slides from [here](http://ismayc.github.io/soc301_s2017/slides/slide_deck.html#week10t) on
