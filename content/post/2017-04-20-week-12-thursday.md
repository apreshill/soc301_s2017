    - Create a Google Doc with your questions and share with isma5720@pacificu.edu

Copy over the content of this document into a new Google Doc and then enter your questions.    
    - Each question should have four possible answers.
    - Don't mark what you choose to be the correct answer on what you turn in, but make note of your choice elsewhere to facilitate your learning.
