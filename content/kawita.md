- Advice for SOC 301 students:

    - Take a deep breath... You may be scared now of using R and/or writing code, but trust Chester, he will get you through the course load and help you every step of the way. It will challenge your work ethic and patience, but it is so gratifying when you get a working code, and Chester will be there to answer any questions you have.
    - Take notes!!!! Even if something doesn't seem important or crucial for the class, trust me, it is! When reading the textbook, take notes, when Chester is lecturing, take notes, if someone asks an interesting question, make a note! This will definitely help you in the long run.
    - Take advantage of your classmates and professor. Ask questions, work together, and find a solution. Go to office hours, make study groups, and most importantly, communicate with those around you. No one is going to know if you are struggling unless you ask for help.

- Brief bio:  "I am a senior Biology major. I intend to go to medical school and I am from southern Oregon. I am really looking forward to tutoring this class!"
