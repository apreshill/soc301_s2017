title: Problem Sets
---

This page will list the Problem Sets and when they will usually be turned in on paper throughout the course (unless otherwise noted below).  You will usually turn in one problem set per group though some assignments will be turned in individually.  You can find discussions about many of the Problem Sets [here](ps-key/index.html).  Links to specific Problem Set discussions from ModernDive will be posted after the Problem Set is turned in below the Problem Set assignment here.


# PS 13 (Due Tues, May 2 by 2:45 PM) {#ps13}

    - Provide your modified code and explain what each line of code is doing.
    - What changes in the results of the analysis?

  - Please be candid and up-front about ways I can improve the course after spring break.  Remember that this course will challenge you and that won't be changing after break, but if I can fix the timing or the way content is covered it is much better that I hear about that NOW and not when the class is over.


# PS 7 (Due Thurs, Mar 16 by 1:00 PM) {#ps7}
