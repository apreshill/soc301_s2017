title: Problem Sets
---

This page will list the Problem Sets and when they will be turned in on paper throughout the course.  You will turn in one problem set per group.  You can find discussions about all of the Problem Sets [here](ps-key/index.html).

Note that the discussion page is updated with the most recent problem sets at the top and the earlier problem sets at the bottom.  Links to specific Problem Set discussions will be posted after the Problem Set is turned in below the Problem Set assignment here.

# Problem Set 4 (Due Thursday, February 23 by 4:20 PM) {#ps4}

- We will be working on this in class on Tuesday and Thursday in groups, but you likely will need to work outside of class to complete it.
- Learning Checks [LC4.14, LC4.16, LC4.18, LC4.19, LC4.21-LC4.28, LC4.30, LC4.33-LC4.34, LC4.36-LC4.37](https://ismayc.github.io/moderndiver-book/4-viz.html)
- To run the R code given in the gray chunks in the textbook, you can use this "sandbox" I've created for you as the last chapter of the DataCamp course.  Click [here](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/effective-data-storytelling-using-the-tidyverse/supplement-to-moderndive-textbook?ex=1).

# Problem Set 3 (Due Tuesday, February 21 by 2:45 PM) {#ps3}

- We will be working on this in class on Tuesday and Thursday in groups, but you likely will need to work outside of class to complete it.
- Learning Checks [LC3.11-LC3.13 and LC3.15](https://ismayc.github.io/moderndiver-book/3-tidy.html) AND [LC4.1-LC4.2, LC4.4, LC4.6-LC4.7, and LC4.10-LC4.13](https://ismayc.github.io/moderndiver-book/4-viz.html)
    - Recall that `View` is not a function that works in DataCamp but does work in RStudio that we will work with later.  You can view the data frames interactively [here](https://ismayc.github.io/Effective-Data-Storytelling-using-the-tidyverse/moderndive.html) though.
    - For LC4.6 and LC4.13, run your code in the [sandbox in DataCamp](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/effective-data-storytelling-using-the-tidyverse/supplement-to-moderndive-textbook?ex=1) and then write your code on your paper.  Discuss what findings you have when looking at the plot.  Remember that scatter-plots only work when analyzing the relationship between two **numerical** variables!

# Problem Set 2 (Due Thursday, February 9 by 4:20 PM) {#ps2}

- We will be working to finish in class on Thursday in groups, but you should have a start on it BEFORE class
- Learning Checks LC3.2-LC3.7, LC3.9-LC3.10 from [ModernDive](https://ismayc.github.io/moderndiver-book/3-tidy.html)
- To run the R code given in the gray chunks in the textbook, you can use this "sandbox" I've created for you as the last chapter of the DataCamp course.  Click [here](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/effective-data-storytelling-using-the-tidyverse/supplement-to-moderndive-textbook?ex=1).

- DISCUSSION [here](ps-key/index.html#ps2-key)

# Problem Set 1 (Due Tuesday, February 7 by 4:20 PM) {#ps1}

- Write down AT LEAST five multiple choice questions covering the **Introduction to R**
DataCamp course.  
    - Each question should have four possible answers.
    - Don't mark what you choose to be the correct answer on what you turn in, but make note of your choice elsewhere to facilitate your learning.
    - Create a Google Doc with your questions and share with isma5720@pacificu.edu
