2. Hand out sheets of paper with group numbers

  - Don't write anything on the cards yet
  - Meet with other people with cards with same number as you

  - You will use both the front and the back of the cards to include information about the two other people in your group
  
3. Who travelled the furthest from Pacific over winter break?

  - Who has the most interesting fact?
  
4. Have them go around the room and introduce themselves 

 - Pronoun
 - Their own interesting fact (I'll try to know everyone's name by Wednesday)

  - Go to next slide with notebook photo
  - Talk about my background
  - Talk about my positions

7. Identify what type each of the variables on your notecards is

8. Why is this classification useful?

  - The type of data will help us steer visualizations and modeling
  - Certain types of analysis only work when comparing continuous data grouped by a categorical variable, for example
  
9. Load up my website <http://ismayc.github.io>

10. Go briefly over syllabus

  - Urge you to come to my office hours or schedule an appointment with me
  - We will be using Slack for communication in this class
      - I'll email you back initially, but it won't last long.
      - Check Slack!
  - **In person conversations are the best way for us to discuss material**
  - If my hours don't work for you, let's schedule a time to chat on Tuesdays and Thursdays
  - Encourage you to work with others on completing assignments and discussing course content
      - Ultimately, you'll do best if you are quizzing yourself on the material as much as possible though.

10. Talk about DataCamp Assignments

  - On DataCamp, we will be using R to work with data and go over content more in depth with examples
  - Check the Course Schedule and DataCamp for when assignments are due.
