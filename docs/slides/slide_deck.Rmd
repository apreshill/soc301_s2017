---

# Questions/concerns about class

- What is the longest assignment we will be given?
--

- Eventually are we going to write our own code to solve problems?
--

- What are good ways to practice programming without DataCamp?
--

- How do you format your exams?

---

# Questions/concerns about class

- If I get questions wrong many times before I get it right on DataCamp, will this hurt my grade?
--

- I worry I don't actually know what I'm doing.
--

- More details about the project.
--

- Does `?`/`help()` only work with explaining functions?

# Some clarifications

- Telling me early that you will be gone on a day in the future is NOT an excused absence
   - You can miss class three times for whatever you wish
   - You need institutional excuse to miss more than three
--

- Just doing the homework is not enough to build sufficient understanding
   - You need to go back over DataCamp, the Learning Checks, and the book on your own to check for understanding
   
---

# Some clarifications   
   
-  I'm not trying to scare you, but quizzes and exams will be HARD and you will struggle if you don't
follow what I am telling you.
  - If you follow the effective learning strategies I have shown you and devote yourself to practice, you'll do great AND you'll retain the material.
  - You'll find that you'll actually be studying LESS, since you won't have to re-learn all the material and cram for exams/quizzes.

# Important R functions/operators from [Chapter 3](https://ismayc.github.io/moderndiver-book/3-tidy.html)

- `library()` (VERY IMPORTANT)
--

- `<-`
--

- `glimpse()`
--

- `?`

# What is meant by "joining data frames" and why is it useful?

# Do joins change the observational unit?

### View [`ideology`](https://ismayc.github.io/Effective-Data-Storytelling-using-the-tidyverse/ideology.html)

- Join based on `"city"`

---

# Do joins change the observational unit?


```{r eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(fivethirtyeight); library(dplyr); library(readr)
data(police_locals)
ideology <- read_csv("http://bit.ly/ideology-csv")
police_join <- inner_join(x = police_locals, y = ideology, 
                          by = "city")
```

### View [`police_join`](https://ismayc.github.io/Effective-Data-Storytelling-using-the-tidyverse/police_join.html)

## THINK ABOUT IT

###  How does linking these two data sets together help in analyzing the relationship between `state_ideology` and percentage of police officers residing in the cities they serve by race?

## Tidy Data

---

## Is this tidy?

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
dem_score <- read_csv("data/dem_score.csv")
dem_score
```

---

## Beginning steps

### Frequently the first thing you should do when given a dataset is to
- check that the data is *tidy*,
- identify the observational unit,
- specify the variables, and
- give the types of variables you are presented with.
### This will help you with 
- choosing the appropriate plot, 
- summarizing the data, and 
- understanding which inferences can be applied.

---

## What is Tidy Data?

<img src="http://garrettgman.github.io/images/tidy-1.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 600px;"/>

1. Each variable forms a column.
2. Each observation forms a row.
3. Each type of observational unit forms a table.

### The third point means we don't mix apples and oranges, keep apples together with apples.

---

## What is Tidy Data?

1. Each observation forms a row. In other words, each row corresponds to a single *observational unit*
1. Each variable forms a column:
    + Some of the variables may be used to identify the *observational units*. For organizational purposes, it's generally better to put these in the left-hand columns
    + Some of the variables may be *observed values* associated with each observational unit
1. Each type of observational unit forms a table.

---

## What is Tidy Data?

### This is just a spreadsheet! 

### But we are very strict about the previous three rules.

## [nycflights13 Package](http://github.com/hadley/nycflights13)

- Loaded via `library(nycflights13)`

- Contains
information about all flights that departed from NYC in
2013: 336,776 flights in total. 

---

## [nycflights13 Package](http://github.com/hadley/nycflights13)

- To help understand what causes delays, it also
includes a number of other useful datasets: <small>
    * `weather`: hourly meterological data for each airport
    * `planes`: construction information about each plane
    * `airports`: airport names and locations
    * `airlines`: translation between two letter carrier codes and names

### All of these data frames are available for viewing [here](https://ismayc.github.io/Effective-Data-Storytelling-using-the-tidyverse/moderndive.html).

--

- You or someone else pays good money for you to get a good education here
--

- I want to do everything in my power to help you learn this material as I see it as THE MOST IMPORTANT class you can take as an undergraduate.
--

- You have many misconceptions about how you learn best.  That's not your fault, but habits must be broken.
--

- Can we build muscles sitting on the couch?

---

## Why are you learning R?

- ~~Because I enjoy partaking in [Schadenfreude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schadenfreude)~~

<center>
`r knitr::include_graphics("figure/google_scholar.png", dpi = 110)`
</center>

---

## Why are you learning R?

- R is free, R improves, R has existed for 40+ years
- You can show what you have learned to a potential employer easily
- I want to prepare you for the real world as best as I can and make you more employable than your competitors

---

## Why are you learning R?

- R will save you TONS of time in the long run. Long term thinking is key.
    - You can easily tweak your code if you need to do another analysis
    - Remembering what drop-down menu some thing is in two years from now in a different program will be hard
