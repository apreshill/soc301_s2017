## Tidy Data

---

## Is this tidy?

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
dem_score <- read_csv("data/dem_score.csv")
dem_score
```

## Beginning steps

### Frequently the first thing you should do when given a dataset is to

- check that the data is *tidy*,
- identify the observational unit,
- specify the variables, and
- give the types of variables you are presented with.

### This will help you with 

- choosing the appropriate plot, 
- summarizing the data, and 
- understanding which inferences can be applied.

---

## What is Tidy Data?

<img src="http://garrettgman.github.io/images/tidy-1.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 600px;"/>

1. Each variable forms a column.
2. Each observation forms a row.
3. Each type of observational unit forms a table.

### The third point means we don't mix apples and oranges, keep apples together with apples.

---

## What is Tidy Data?

1. Each observation forms a row. In other words, each row corresponds to a single *observational unit*
1. Each variable forms a column:
    + Some of the variables may be used to identify the *observational units*. For organizational purposes, it's generally better to put these in the left-hand columns
    + Some of the variables may be *observed values* associated with each observational unit
1. Each type of observational unit forms a table.

## What is Tidy Data?

### This is just a spreadsheet! 

### But we are very strict about the previous three rules.

## [nycflights13 Package](http://github.com/hadley/nycflights13)

- Loaded via `library(nycflights13)`

- Contains
information about all flights that departed from NYC in
2013: 336,776 flights in total. 

---

## [nycflights13 Package](http://github.com/hadley/nycflights13)

- To help understand what causes delays, it also
includes a number of other useful datasets: <small>
    * `weather`: hourly meterological data for each airport
    * `planes`: construction information about each plane
    * `airports`: airport names and locations
    * `airlines`: translation between two letter carrier codes and names

### All of these data frames are available for viewing [here](https://ismayc.github.io/Effective-Data-Storytelling-using-the-tidyverse/moderndive.html).

## You Should Learn to Program

## Easy classes are worthless classes

> - You won't retain any of the material covered
> - You or someone else pays good money for you to get a good education here
> - I want to do everything in my power to help you learn this material as I see it as THE MOST IMPORTANT class you can take as an undergraduate.
> - You have many misconceptions about how you learn best.  That's not your fault, but habits must be broken.
> - Can we build muscles sitting on the couch?

## Why are you learning R?

- ~~Because I enjoy partaking in [Schadenfreude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schadenfreude)~~

<center>
`r knitr::include_graphics("figure/google_scholar.png", dpi = 110)`
</center>

---

## Why are you learning R?

- R is free, R improves, R has existed for 40+ years
- You can show what you have learned to a potential employer easily
- I want to prepare you for the real world as best as I can and make you more employable than your competitors
- R will save you TONS of time in the long run. Long term thinking is key.
    - You can easily tweak your code if you need to do another analysis
    - Remembering what drop-down menu some thing is in two years from now in a different program will be hard
