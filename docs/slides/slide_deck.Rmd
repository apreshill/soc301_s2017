# Jazzing up your Group Project plots

- Make sure to add labels to your axes and a title to your plot via
`labs(x = , y = , title = )`.  
  - Remember to use the `+` to add labs/themes to your plot
just like you do with `geom_`etries

---

# Jazzing up your Group Project plots


- Think about using `theme_fivethirtyeight()` as I did in the `example_vignette.Rmd`.  
  - Note your need to install the `ggthemes` package and load it via `library(ggthemes)` in the top R Markdown chunk.
- Another option for cool themes of your plots is `theme_ipsum()` in the [`hrbrthemes` package](https://github.com/hrbrmstr/hrbrthemes)

# Warmup
--

1. How can I better address this feedback?  
    - "more of a social science aspect to the data we are using in our work."
2. "I was under the impression we were going to analyze data more than we have been."
    - What does 'analyzing data' mean to you?
3.  Why do I ask DataCamp questions over content we haven't explicitly covered?

# Comment

### "I wish there was a way for us to go over material with you if we had to miss class one day."
--

  - I'm happy to chat with you (even be it over video chat).  All it takes is you reaching out to me.
  - I'd encourage you to look over the slides first to better understand what you've missed and to do the reading assignment in the textbook before reaching out to me.  For example, `geom_col` was discussed when we talked about [barplots](#geomcol).

# Work day!

- Look over my comments on your Group Project
  - Press the spellcheck button in R Markdown!
    ```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
    knitr::include_graphics("figure/spellcheck.png")
    ```
- Do [Problem Set 8](https://goo.gl/forms/tCBFF7cuMbYgPIyb2) 
- Finish [dplyr Review](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/effective-data-storytelling-using-the-tidyverse/dplyr-review-8) (Due today at 11:59 PM)
- Read [Chapter 6 of ModernDive](https://ismayc.github.io/moderndiver-book/6-sim.html)

## ENJOY YOUR SPRING BREAK!

# Warmup

### Write the code to produce the following table using ALL 5 of the 5MV functions in the `dplyr` package on the `gapminder` data frame in the `gapminder` R package.  
- Your code will be simplest if you use `|` in your `filter`.
- Notice how the data is sorted.

<br>

```{r echo=FALSE}
library(gapminder)
gapminder %>% 
  dplyr::filter(country %in% c("Belgium", "South Africa") | continent == "Oceania") %>%
  group_by(continent, country) %>% 
  summarize(mean_gdp_all_years = mean(gdpPercap)) %>% 
  mutate(mean_minus_one = mean_gdp_all_years - 1) %>% 
  arrange(mean_gdp_all_years) %>% 
  knitr::kable(format = "html")
```
