# Warmup

Write the code necessary to produce the last plot using the `US_births_2014` data frame from the [Scatter-plots and Line-graphs](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/effective-data-storytelling-using-the-tidyverse/scatter-plots-line-graphs?ex=4) chapter of DataCamp:


```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=6, fig.width=11}
library(ggplot2)
library(fivethirtyeight)
library(dplyr)
US_births_2014 <- US_births_2000_2014 %>% filter(year == 2014)
ggplot(data = US_births_2014,
       mapping = aes(x = date,
           y = births)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = day_of_week)) 
```

---

# Discuss in groups of three

- What stands out to you when you look at this plot?  In other words, what stories could be told by observing this data?

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=5.3, fig.width=11}
library(ggplot2)
library(fivethirtyeight)
library(dplyr)
library(plotly)
US_births_2014 <- US_births_2000_2014 %>% filter(year == 2014)

# Histogram Basics

---

### Consider the following numerical data frame

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
numeric_var <- c(10, 12, 14, 15, 18, 21)
hist_example <- data_frame(numeric_var)
hist_example
```

--

```{r echo=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
numeric_var <- c(10, 12, 14, 15, 18, 21)
hist_example <- data_frame(numeric_var)
hist_example
```


- Place the data into two bins of size 6
- Then produce a table showing how many data points fall in each bin

---

### Sketch a plot of this frequency table

Bin     | Count
--------|-------
(9-15] | 4
(15-21] | 2

--

```{r fig.height=4}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = hist_example, mapping = aes(x = numeric_var)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 6, color = "black", fill = "white")
```

---

class: center, middle

# Recall that a statistical graphic is

## A <small>`mapping`</small> of <br> <small>`data`</small> variables


## to <br> <small>`aes()`</small>thetic attributes


## of <br> <small>`geom_`</small>etric objects.

---

## Practice in pairs

- Write the code to produce a histogram of the humidity recordings in the [<small>`weather`</small> data frame](https://ismayc.github.io/Effective-Data-Storytelling-using-the-tidyverse/moderndive.html#weather) from the <small>`nycflights13`</small> package 
  - with a bin width of 15, 
  - white border color, and 
  - fill with the [color of your choosing](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~tzheng/files/Rcolor.pdf).
- Practice in the DataCamp sandbox at <br> http://bit.ly/stats-sandbox

--

```{r include=FALSE}
library(nycflights13)
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = weather, mapping = aes(x = humid)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 15, color = "white", fill = "goldenrod")
```

- THINK ABOUT IT: What does this plot tell us?

---

# Faceting

- Oftentimes, we'd like to produce a small multiple of the same plot across the levels of a different variable. Suppose we'd like to look at the plot created on the last slide *across* the different <small>`origin`</small> airports.
--

  - Use the code given in Section 4.6 of [ModernDive](https://ismayc.github.io/moderndiver-book/4-viz.html#facets) and the plot you created on the last slide.
  - Write down your code on paper and test in the [sandbox](http://bit.ly/stats-sandbox)

```{r include=FALSE}
library(nycflights13)
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = weather, mapping = aes(x = humid)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 15, color = "white", fill = "goldenrod") +
  facet_wrap(facets = ~ origin)
```
--

- THINK ABOUT IT: What does this faceted plot tell us?

---

# Faceting

- Write the code to produce the plot below

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=6, fig.width=11}
library(nycflights13)
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = weather, mapping = aes(x = humid, fill = origin)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 15, color = "white") +
  facet_wrap(facets = ~ origin)
```

---

# Another way to <small>`facet`</small>

```{r fig.height=5, fig.width=11}
library(nycflights13); library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = weather, mapping = aes(x = humid, fill = origin)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 5, color = "white") + # NOTE bins here
  facet_grid(facets = origin ~ .)
```

---

# Explanatory and Response Variables

### Suppose we were interested in investigating the humidity throughout 2013 across the airports in NYC.

- What would be the explanatory and response variables?

- Note there is only one correct answer here.

---

# Boxplots

- Another way to view the relationship between a categorical explanatory variable and a numerical response variable is via a boxplot.  Think about how we might write the code to produce the boxplot for humidity across airports.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=4}
library(nycflights13)
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = weather, mapping = aes(x = origin, y = humid)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

---

# Warmup

### Is this data frame showing [average total fertility by country by year (since 1945)](http://ismayc.github.io/Effective-Data-Storytelling-using-the-tidyverse/total_fertility.html) a tidy data frame?  

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
total_fertility <- readr::read_csv("data/total_fertility.csv") 
colnames(total_fertility)[1] <- "country"
total_fertility <- total_fertility %>% 
  select(country, `1945`:`2015`) %>% 
  na.omit()
knitr::kable(head(select(total_fertility, country, `1945`:`1956`), 3), format = "html")
```


- <small>If so, what is the observational unit and what are the variables?</small>
- <small>If not, what would three rows of a tidy data set look like with variable names at the top?</small>

### Consider the following data in tidy format:

```{r echo=FALSE}
simple_ex <-
  data_frame(
    A = c(1, 2, 3, 4),
    B = c(1, 2, 3, 4),
    C = c(3, 2, 1, 2),
    D = c("a", "a", "b", "b")
  )
simple_ex %>% knitr::kable(format="html")
```


- Sketch the graphics below on paper, where the `x`-axis is variable `A` and the `y`-axis is variable `B`

1. <small>A scatter plot</small>
1. <small>A scatter plot where the `color` of the points corresponds to `D`</small>
1. <small>A scatter plot where the `size` of the points corresponds to `C`</small>
1. <small>A line graph</small>
1. <small>A line graph where the `color` of the line corresponds to `D`</small>


---

## Reproducing the plots in <small>`ggplot2`</small>

### 1. A scatterplot

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = simple_ex, mapping = aes(x = A, y = B)) + 
  geom_point()
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.height=4.5}
ggplot(data = simple_ex, aes(x = A, y = B)) + 
  geom_point()
```

```


---

## Reproducing the plots in <small>`ggplot2`</small>

ggplot(data = simple_ex, mapping = aes(x = A, y = B, size = C)) + 
  geom_point()
```
--

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.height=4.5}

## Why is tidy data important?

- Think about trying to plot total fertility across years in the simplest way possible with the data on [Warmup slide](#warmup).
--

- It would be much easier if the data looked like what follows instead so we could put <small>`year`</small> on the <small>`x`</small>-axis and <small>`fert`</small> on the <small>`y`</small>-axis.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
total_fertility <- readr::read_csv("data/total_fertility.csv") 
colnames(total_fertility)[1] <- "country"
total_fertility <- total_fertility %>% 
  select(country, `1945`:`2015`) %>% 
  na.omit()
set.seed(3)
total_fert_tidy <- total_fertility %>% 
  sample_n(6) %>% 
  gather(-country, key = "year", value = "fert") %>% 
  mutate(year = as.numeric(year)) 
total_fert_tidy %>% 
  sample_n(6) %>% 
  arrange(country) %>% 
  knitr::kable(format = "html")
```

---

## Making a scatterplot

```{r fig.height=5.5}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = total_fert_tidy, mapping = aes(x = year, y = fert)) +
  geom_point()
```


---

## Discussing the scatterplot

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.width=11, fig.height=5.5}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = total_fert_tidy, mapping = aes(x = year, y = fert)) +
  geom_point()
```

- What stands out to you as you look at this plot?
- What other information would be useful here?


---

## Identifying the countries

```{r echo=FALSE}
total_fert_tidy %>% distinct(country) %>% ungroup() %>% 
  arrange(country) %>% knitr::kable(format = "html")
```

--

- How could we identify the countries on the plot?
--

- This is another reason why *tidy data* is so valuable.  <br> Check this out!

---

## Color by country

```{r fig.width=11, fig.height=5.5}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = total_fert_tidy, 
       mapping = aes(x = year, y = fert, color = country)) +
  geom_point()
```

---

## Shape by country

```{r fig.width=11, fig.height=5.5}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = total_fert_tidy, 
       mapping = aes(x = year, y = fert, shape = country)) +
  geom_point()
```

---

## Color and shape by country

```{r fig.width=11, fig.height=5}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = total_fert_tidy, 
       mapping = aes(x = year, y = fert, 
                     color = country, shape = country)) +
  geom_point()
```

```{r}
library(dplyr)
gap2007 <- gapminder %>% filter(year == 2007)
head(gap2007, n = 10)
```

---

## What code is needed to produce this plot?

- Write the code on paper and then discuss in groups of 3.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=3.5}
ggplot(data = gap2007, mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point()
```

--

- There are `r nrow(total_fertility)` countries included here.  What would be a different/better way we could highlight points than by country
that would be of interest here?

---

## Coloring by `continent`

- Write the code on paper and then discuss in groups of 3.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=5}
ggplot(data = gap2007, mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = continent))
```
--

- What information is added by the coloring here?

---

# Some clarifications

- Telling me early that you will be gone on a day in the future is NOT an excused absence
   - You can miss class three times for whatever you wish
   - You need institutional excuse to miss more than three
--

- Just doing the homework is not enough to build sufficient understanding
   - You need to go back over DataCamp, the Learning Checks, and the book on your own to check for understanding
   
---

# Some clarifications   
   
-  I'm not trying to scare you, but quizzes and exams will be HARD and you will struggle if you don't
follow what I am telling you.
  - If you follow the effective learning strategies I have shown you and devote yourself to practice, you'll do great AND you'll retain the material.
  - You'll find that you'll actually be studying LESS, since you won't have to re-learn all the material and cram for exams/quizzes.

---

## Beginning steps

### Frequently the first thing you should do when given a dataset is to
- check that the data is *tidy*,
- identify the observational unit,
- specify the variables, and
- give the types of variables you are presented with.
### This will help you with 
- choosing the appropriate plot, 
- summarizing the data, and 
- understanding which inferences can be applied.

---

## What is Tidy Data?

<img src="http://garrettgman.github.io/images/tidy-1.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 600px;"/>

1. Each variable forms a column.
2. Each observation forms a row.
3. Each type of observational unit forms a table.

### The third point means we don't mix apples and oranges, keep apples together with apples.

## What is Tidy Data?

1. Each observation forms a row. In other words, each row corresponds to a single *observational unit*
1. Each variable forms a column:
    + Some of the variables may be used to identify the *observational units*. For organizational purposes, it's generally better to put these in the left-hand columns
    + Some of the variables may be *observed values* associated with each observational unit
1. Each type of observational unit forms a table.

## What is Tidy Data?

### This is just a spreadsheet! 

### But we are very strict about the previous three rules.
