# Jazzing up your Group Project plots

- Make sure to add labels to your axes and a title to your plot via
`labs(x = , y = , title = )`.  
  - Remember to use the `+` to add labs/themes to your plot
just like you do with `geom_`etries

---

# Jazzing up your Group Project plots


- Think about using `theme_fivethirtyeight()` as I did in the `example_vignette.Rmd`.  
  - Note your need to install the `ggthemes` package and load it via `library(ggthemes)` in the top R Markdown chunk.
- Another option for cool themes of your plots is `theme_ipsum()` in the [`hrbrthemes` package](https://github.com/hrbrmstr/hrbrthemes)

# Warmup
--

1. How can I better address this feedback?  
    - "more of a social science aspect to the data we are using in our work."
2. "I was under the impression we were going to analyze data more than we have been."
    - What does 'analyzing data' mean to you?
3.  Why do I ask DataCamp questions over content we haven't explicitly covered?

---

# Comment

### "I wish there was a way for us to go over material with you if we had to miss class one day."
--

  - I'm happy to chat with you (even be it over video chat).  All it takes is you reaching out to me.
  - I'd encourage you to look over the slides first to better understand what you've missed and to do the reading assignment in the textbook before reaching out to me.  FoR Simulations Example, `geom_col` was discussed when we talked about [barplots](#geomcol).

---

# Work day!

- Look over my comments on your Group Project
  - Press the spellcheck button in R Markdown!
    ```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
    knitr::include_graphics("figure/spellcheck.png")
    ```
- Do [Problem Set 8](https://goo.gl/forms/tCBFF7cuMbYgPIyb2) 
- Finish [dplyr Review](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/effective-data-storytelling-using-the-tidyverse/dplyr-review-8) (Due today at 11:59 PM)
- Read [Chapter 6 of ModernDive](https://ismayc.github.io/moderndiver-book/6-sim.html)

## ENJOY YOUR SPRING BREAK!

# Warmup

### Write the code to produce the following table using ALL 5 of the 5MV functions in the `dplyr` package on the `gapminder` data frame in the `gapminder` R package.  
- Your code will be simplest if you use `|` in your `filter`.
- Notice how the data is sorted.

# Other verbs

## `rename()`

- To change a variable's name in a data frame to a new name
- New name comes before the `=`, old name comes after the `=`
--

```{r}
gap2 <- gapminder
gap2 <- gap2 %>%

# Group Options

- If you want to work in a group of four, you can do so BUT you'll need to complete 2 unrelated vignettes.
--

- If you are left in a group of two, I will work with you to set up an assignment that is fair.
--

- Final decisions on group members MUST be made by the end of the day today.  I won't accept any changes in group members after today.
--

- If you have problems contacting your group members, please let me know on Slack as soon as possible.  **Check** SLACK at least once per day!


---


# Group Options

- If you are already having trouble setting up times to meet to work on the Group Project, you are going to have an even harder time going forward.
    - Pick a standard time to meet that works for everyone.
    - I would count a missed group meeting as a failing grade for the project.
--
- You will need to meet outside of class to complete this project.  This could easily include having a Google Hangout video chat as needed.  Further, if you set up tasks appropriately, you may not need to meet in person much.

---

# Set-up Google Drive on your computer

- Click on the link I sent you for your Group Project folder in your email or in the Slack message I sent to your group

    - https://www.google.com/drive/download/
--

- Open the Rproj file in the Google Drive folder on your computer
--

- Make sure that `script.R` opens with RStudio
--

- Try to Knit `group_project.Rmd`

---

# Group Project Deadlines

- Always check [the Group Project Outline](https://ismayc.github.io/soc301_s2017/group_project_outline/index.html) to make sure you are on schedule and more specific deadlines

- March 14 (2:45 PM) - Group Project Draft Due

## The `gapminder` data frame in the `gapminder` package

```{r}
library(gapminder)
library(dplyr)
glimpse(gapminder)
```

---

## Base R versus the `tidyverse`

- Say we wanted mean life expectancy across all years for Asia
--

```{r}
# Base R
asia <- gapminder[gapminder$continent == "Asia", ]
mean(asia$lifeExp)
```

```{r}

gapminder %>% filter(continent == "Asia") %>%

## The pipe `%>%`

`r knitr::include_graphics("figure/pipe.png")` &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; `r knitr::include_graphics("figure/MagrittePipe.jpg")`
--

- A way to chain together commands
--

- It is *essentially* the `dplyr` equivalent to the <br> `+` in `ggplot2`

---

# The 5NG of data viz
--

### `geom_point()`<br> `geom_line()` <br> `geom_histogram()`<br>  `geom_boxplot()`<br> `geom_bar()`

---
# The 5MV of data wrangling
### `filter()` <br> `summarize()` <br> `group_by()` <br> `mutate()` <br> `arrange()`

---

# `filter()`

- Allows you to select a subset of the rows of a data frame. 

- The arguments are the "filters" that you'd like to apply.
--

```{r}
library(gapminder); library(dplyr)
gap_2007 <- gapminder %>% filter(year == 2007)
head(gap_2007)
```

---

# Logical operators

- Use `==` to compare a variable to a value
--

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(gapminder); library(dplyr)
gap_2007 <- gapminder %>% filter(year = 2007)
```

```
Error: filter() takes unnamed arguments. Do you need `==`?
```

---

# Logical operators

- Use `|` to check for any in multiple filters being true:
--

```{r eval=FALSE}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == 2002 | continent == "Europe")
```
--

```{r echo=FALSE}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == 2002 | continent == "Europe")
```

---

# Logical operators

- Use `&` or `,` to check for all of multiple filters being true:
--

```{r eval=FALSE}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == 2002, continent == "Europe")
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == 2002, continent == "Europe")
```

---

# Logical operators

- Use `%in%` to check for any being true <br> (shortcut to using `|` repeatedly)
--

```{r eval=FALSE}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(country %in% c("Argentina", "Belgium", "Mexico"),
         year %in% c(1987, 1992))
```
--

```{r echo=FALSE}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(country %in% c("Argentina", "Belgium", "Mexico"),
         year %in% c(1987, 1992))
```


---

# `summarize()`

- Any numerical summary that you want to apply to a column of a data frame is specified within `summarize()`.

```{r eval=FALSE}
max_exp_1997 <- gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == 1997) %>% 
  summarize(max_exp = max(lifeExp))
max_exp_1997
```
--

```{r echo=FALSE}
max_exp_1997 <- gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == 1997) %>% 
  summarize(max_exp = max(lifeExp))
max_exp_1997
```



---

### Combining `summarize()` with `group_by()`

- When you'd like to determine a numerical summary for all
levels of a different categorical variable

```{r eval=FALSE}
max_exp_1997_by_cont <- gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == 1997) %>% 
  group_by(continent) %>%
  summarize(max_exp = max(lifeExp))
knitr::kable(max_exp_1997_by_cont, format = "html")
```

--
```{r echo=FALSE}
max_exp_1997_by_cont <- gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == 1997) %>% 
  group_by(continent) %>%
  summarize(max_exp = max(lifeExp))
knitr::kable(max_exp_1997_by_cont, format = "html")
```

# Warmup

What code is needed to produce this plot using the `na.omit(flying)` data frame derived from the `fivethirtyeight` package?  Make sure to load all needed libraries.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=5.7, fig.width=11, fig.align='center'}

# `scale_fill_manual`

- We will use `scale_`s sparingly but they can be nice for customizing your plots more

### Notes

- Remember that faceting is setting up a formula so it needs a `~`.  You'll get an error without it.
- Note that the `+` must appear at the end of the line of code NOT at the beginning.

library(okcupiddata)
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = profiles, mapping = aes(x = orientation)) +

---

# Stacked barplot

- Uses `fill` to change the colors of the bars of the `x` variable based on the values of another variable
--

- What code is needed to produce this plot?

```{r echo=FALSE}
library(okcupiddata)
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = profiles, mapping = aes(x = orientation)) +

```


---

# Side-by-side barplot

- Uses `position = "dodge"` to place the bars next to each other for each group of the `x` variable
--

- What code is needed to produce this plot?

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.width=11}
library(okcupiddata)
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = profiles, mapping = aes(x = orientation)) +

```

---

# Faceted barplot

- Uses `facet_wrap()` or `facet_grid()` to make small multiples of the plot
--

- What code is needed to produce this plot?

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.width=11}
library(okcupiddata)
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = profiles, mapping = aes(x = orientation)) +

### Consider the following numerical data frame

```{r eval=FALSE}

hist_example <- data_frame(numeric_var)
hist_example

library(dplyr)
numeric_var <- c(10, 12, 14, 15, 18, 21)
hist_example <- data_frame(numeric_var)
hist_example
```


- Place the data into two bins of size 6
- Then produce a table showing how many data points fall in each bin

---

### Sketch a plot of this frequency table

Bin     | Count
--------|-------
(9-15] | 4
(15-21] | 2

--

```{r fig.height=4}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = hist_example, mapping = aes(x = numeric_var)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 6, color = "black", fill = "white")
```

## Practice in pairs

- Write the code to produce a histogram of the humidity recordings in the [<small>`weather`</small> data frame](https://ismayc.github.io/Effective-Data-Storytelling-using-the-tidyverse/moderndive.html#weather) from the <small>`nycflights13`</small> package 
  - with a bin width of 15, 
  - white border color, and 
  - fill with the [color of your choosing](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~tzheng/files/Rcolor.pdf).
- Practice in the DataCamp sandbox at <br> http://bit.ly/stats-sandbox

--

```{r include=FALSE}
library(nycflights13)
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = weather, mapping = aes(x = humid)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 15, color = "white", fill = "goldenrod")
```

- THINK ABOUT IT: What does this plot tell us?

---

# Faceting

- Oftentimes, we'd like to produce a small multiple of the same plot across the levels of a different variable. Suppose we'd like to look at the plot created on the last slide *across* the different <small>`origin`</small> airports.
--

  - Use the code given in Section 4.6 of [ModernDive](https://ismayc.github.io/moderndiver-book/4-viz.html#facets) and the plot you created on the last slide.
  - Write down your code on paper and test in the [sandbox](http://bit.ly/stats-sandbox)

```{r include=FALSE}
library(nycflights13)
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = weather, mapping = aes(x = humid)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 15, color = "white", fill = "goldenrod") +
  facet_wrap(facets = ~ origin)
```
--

- THINK ABOUT IT: What does this faceted plot tell us?

---

# Faceting

- Write the code to produce the plot below

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=6, fig.width=11}
library(nycflights13)
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = weather, mapping = aes(x = humid, fill = origin)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 15, color = "white") +
  facet_wrap(facets = ~ origin)
```

---

# Another way to <small>`facet`</small>

```{r fig.height=5, fig.width=11}
library(nycflights13); library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = weather, mapping = aes(x = humid, fill = origin)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 5, color = "white") + # NOTE bins here
  facet_grid(facets = origin ~ .)
```

---

# Explanatory and Response Variables

### Suppose we were interested in investigating the humidity throughout 2013 across the airports in NYC.

- What would be the explanatory and response variables?

- Note there is only one correct answer here.

---

# Boxplots

- Another way to view the relationship between a categorical explanatory variable and a numerical response variable is via a boxplot.  Think about how we might write the code to produce the boxplot for humidity across airports.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=4}
library(nycflights13)
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = weather, mapping = aes(x = origin, y = humid)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

## Why is tidy data important?

- Think about trying to plot total fertility across years in the simplest way possible with the data on [Warmup slide](#warmup).
--

- It would be much easier if the data looked like what follows instead so we could put <small>`year`</small> on the <small>`x`</small>-axis and <small>`fert`</small> on the <small>`y`</small>-axis.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
total_fertility <- readr::read_csv("data/total_fertility.csv") 
colnames(total_fertility)[1] <- "country"
total_fertility <- total_fertility %>% 
  select(country, `1945`:`2015`) %>% 
  na.omit()
set.seed(3)
total_fert_tidy <- total_fertility %>% 
  sample_n(6) %>% 
  gather(-country, key = "year", value = "fert") %>% 
  mutate(year = as.numeric(year)) 
total_fert_tidy %>% 
  sample_n(6) %>% 
  arrange(country) %>% 
  knitr::kable(format = "html")
```

---

## Making a scatterplot

```{r fig.height=5.5}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = total_fert_tidy, mapping = aes(x = year, y = fert)) +
  geom_point()
```


---

## Discussing the scatterplot

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.width=11, fig.height=5.5}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = total_fert_tidy, mapping = aes(x = year, y = fert)) +
  geom_point()
```

- What stands out to you as you look at this plot?
- What other information would be useful here?


---

## Identifying the countries

```{r echo=FALSE}
total_fert_tidy %>% distinct(country) %>% ungroup() %>% 
  arrange(country) %>% knitr::kable(format = "html")
```

--

- How could we identify the countries on the plot?
--

- This is another reason why *tidy data* is so valuable.  <br> Check this out!

---

# Questions/concerns about class

- What is the longest assignment we will be given?

- Eventually are we going to write our own code to solve problems?
--

- What are good ways to practice programming without DataCamp?
--

- How do you format your exams?

---

# Questions/concerns about class

- If I get questions wrong many times before I get it right on DataCamp, will this hurt my grade?
--

- I worry I don't actually know what I'm doing.
--

- More details about the project.
--

# Some clarifications

- Telling me early that you will be gone on a day in the future is NOT an excused absence
   - You can miss class three times for whatever you wish
   - You need institutional excuse to miss more than three
--

- Just doing the homework is not enough to build sufficient understanding
   - You need to go back over DataCamp, the Learning Checks, and the book on your own to check for understanding
   
---

# Some clarifications   
   
-  I'm not trying to scare you, but quizzes and exams will be HARD and you will struggle if you don't
follow what I am telling you.
  - If you follow the effective learning strategies I have shown you and devote yourself to practice, you'll do great AND you'll retain the material.
  - You'll find that you'll actually be studying LESS, since you won't have to re-learn all the material and cram for exams/quizzes.

# Do joins change the observational unit?


```{r eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(fivethirtyeight); library(dplyr); library(readr)
data(police_locals)
ideology <- read_csv("http://bit.ly/ideology-csv")
police_join <- inner_join(x = police_locals, y = ideology, 
                          by = "city")
```

## Tidy Data

---

## Is this tidy?

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
dem_score <- read_csv("data/dem_score.csv")
dem_score
```

---

## Beginning steps

### Frequently the first thing you should do when given a dataset is to
- check that the data is *tidy*,
- identify the observational unit,
- specify the variables, and
- give the types of variables you are presented with.
### This will help you with 
- choosing the appropriate plot, 
- summarizing the data, and 
- understanding which inferences can be applied.

---

## What is Tidy Data?

<img src="http://garrettgman.github.io/images/tidy-1.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 600px;"/>

1. Each variable forms a column.
2. Each observation forms a row.
3. Each type of observational unit forms a table.

### The third point means we don't mix apples and oranges, keep apples together with apples.

---

## What is Tidy Data?

1. Each observation forms a row. In other words, each row corresponds to a single *observational unit*
1. Each variable forms a column:
    + Some of the variables may be used to identify the *observational units*. For organizational purposes, it's generally better to put these in the left-hand columns
    + Some of the variables may be *observed values* associated with each observational unit
1. Each type of observational unit forms a table.

---

## What is Tidy Data?

### This is just a spreadsheet! 

### But we are very strict about the previous three rules.
