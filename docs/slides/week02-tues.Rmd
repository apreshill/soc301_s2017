## Asking for help

- Recommended:  Post your problem and drag a screenshot image of what you have tried to the #general channel on Slack.
- If you know the answer to a question there, please attempt to answer it.  It will help you learn!
- Send me a private message on Slack (@chester)
- Discuss your problems with the tutors in person
- Last resort, send the tutors a private message on Slack

## You Should Learn to Program

```{r echo=FALSE}
library("htmltools")
library("vembedr")
embed_url("https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfBWk4nw440&t=7s")
```


## Easy classes are worthless classes

> - You won't retain any of the material covered
> - You or someone else pays good money for you to get a good education here
> - I want to do everything in my power to help you learn this material as I see it as THE MOST IMPORTANT class you can take as an undergraduate.
> - You have many misconceptions about how you learn best.  That's not your fault, but habits must be broken.
> - Can we build muscles sitting on the couch?

## Why are you learning R?

- ~~Because I enjoy partaking in [Schadenfreude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schadenfreude)~~

## Why are you learning R?

> - R is free, R improves, R has been around for a long time
> - You can show what you have learned to a potential employer easily
> - I want to prepare you for the real world as best as I can and make you more employable than your competitors

> - R will save you TONS of time in the long run. Long term thinking is key.

>    - You can easily tweak your code if you need to do another analysis
>    - Good luck trying to remember what drop-down menu some thing is in two years from now in a different program

- [Advice from former students](http://ismayc.github.io/soc301_s2017/advice_from_former/index.html)

- Practice!

## Get into groups of 3 or 4

- Pass your multiple choice questions to someone else in your group
    - Take the "quiz" with no notes
    - Discuss your answers with your group
    - Take another "quiz"
    - Rinse and repeat

# Check the [webpage](https://ismayc.github.io/soc301_s2017/)!

# I want your feedback!

## To do for next time

- Study for Quiz #1 on Thursday, February 9 using the strategies laid out 
    - The quiz will cover the Introduction to R DataCamp course 
- Review the Learning Strategies given [here](http://www.learningscientists.org/posters) and commit to using them to succeed in learning
- Complete DataCamp profile
- Read Chapter 3 of [ModernDive](http://moderndive.com)
    - As you read attempt the Learning Checks for understanding
- Begin work on [Applying R Basics](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/effective-data-storytelling-using-the-tidyverse/applying-r-basics?ex=1) DataCamp chapter (Due on February 14 at 1 PM)

## Minute Paper

(Half sheet of paper is fine.  Share with your neighbor.)

- What are the big take-aways for you from class today?
- What questions do you have about the course?  About the material you've learned so far?
