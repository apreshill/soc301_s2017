---

# Questions/concerns about class

- What is the longest assignment we will be given?
--

- Eventually are we going to write our own code to solve problems?
--

- What are good ways to practice programming without DataCamp?
--

- How do you format your exams?

---

# Questions/concerns about class

- If I get questions wrong many times before I get it right on DataCamp, will this hurt my grade?
--

- I worry I don't actually know what I'm doing.
--

- More details about the project.
--

- Does `?`/`help()` only work with explaining functions?

## Studying well and efficiently

---

# Some clarifications

- Telling me early that you will be gone on a day in the future is NOT an excused absence
   - You can miss class three times for whatever you wish
   - You need institutional excuse to miss more than three
--

- Just doing the homework is not enough to build sufficient understanding
   - You need to go back over DataCamp, the Learning Checks, and the book on your own to check for understanding
   
---

# Some clarifications   
   
-  I'm not trying to scare you, but quizzes and exams will be HARD and you will struggle if you don't
follow what I am telling you.
  - If you follow the effective learning strategies I have shown you and devote yourself to practice, you'll do great AND you'll retain the material.
  - You'll find that you'll actually be studying LESS, since you won't have to re-learn all the material and cram for exams/quizzes.

# Do joins change the observational unit?



```r
library(fivethirtyeight); library(dplyr); library(readr)
data(police_locals)
ideology &lt;- read_csv("http://bit.ly/ideology-csv")

## THINK ABOUT IT

###  How does linking these two data sets together help in analyzing the relationship between `state_ideology` and percentage of police officers residing in the cities they serve by race?

# What is a statistical graphic?

# Grammar of Graphics

### Wilkinson (2005) laid out the proposed "Grammar of Graphics"

&lt;img src="figure/graphics.jpg" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;


---

# Grammar of Graphics in R

### Wickham implemented the grammar in R in the `ggplot2` package

&lt;img src="figure/ggplot2.jpg" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;


---

# But...what is a statistical graphic?

- A statistical graphic is a mapping of `data` variables to `aes()`thetic
attributes of `geom_`etric objects.

---

# A scatter-plot example

From `ggplot2movies` package, the `movies` data set:

![](slide_deck_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

---

# A scatter-plot example - the code!

From `ggplot2movies` package, the [`movies`](ismayc.github.io/effective-Data-Storytelling-using-the-tidyverse/movies.html) data set:


```r
library(ggplot2); library(ggplot2movies)
ggplot(data = movies, aes(x = budget, y = rating)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Movie Budget", y = "IMDB Rating", 
       title = "IMDB Rating vs Budget")
```

![](slide_deck_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

---

# A line-graph example

From `nycflights13` package, the `flights` data set:


```
## 
## Attaching package: 'dplyr'
```

```
## The following objects are masked from 'package:stats':
## 
##     filter, lag
```

```
## The following objects are masked from 'package:base':
## 
##     intersect, setdiff, setequal, union
```

```
## 
## Attaching package: 'lubridate'
```

```
## The following object is masked from 'package:vembedr':
## 
##     hms
```

```
## The following object is masked from 'package:base':
## 
##     date
```

## Beginning steps

### Frequently the first thing you should do when given a dataset is to
- check that the data is *tidy*,
- identify the observational unit,
- specify the variables, and
- give the types of variables you are presented with.
### This will help you with 
- choosing the appropriate plot, 
- summarizing the data, and 
- understanding which inferences can be applied.

---

## What is Tidy Data?

&lt;img src="http://garrettgman.github.io/images/tidy-1.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 600px;"/&gt;

1. Each variable forms a column.
2. Each observation forms a row.
3. Each type of observational unit forms a table.

### The third point means we don't mix apples and oranges, keep apples together with apples.

---

## What is Tidy Data?

1. Each observation forms a row. In other words, each row corresponds to a single *observational unit*
1. Each variable forms a column:
    + Some of the variables may be used to identify the *observational units*. For organizational purposes, it's generally better to put these in the left-hand columns
    + Some of the variables may be *observed values* associated with each observational unit
1. Each type of observational unit forms a table.

---

## What is Tidy Data?

### This is just a spreadsheet! 

### But we are very strict about the previous three rules.

## [nycflights13 Package](http://github.com/hadley/nycflights13)

- Loaded via `library(nycflights13)`

- Contains
information about all flights that departed from NYC in
2013: 336,776 flights in total. 

---

## [nycflights13 Package](http://github.com/hadley/nycflights13)

- To help understand what causes delays, it also
includes a number of other useful datasets: &lt;small&gt;
    * `weather`: hourly meterological data for each airport
    * `planes`: construction information about each plane
    * `airports`: airport names and locations
    * `airlines`: translation between two letter carrier codes and names

### All of these data frames are available for viewing [here](https://ismayc.github.io/Effective-Data-Storytelling-using-the-tidyverse/moderndive.html).

## Asking for help

- Recommended:  Post your problem and drag a screenshot image of what you have tried to the #general channel on Slack.
- If you know the answer to a question there, please attempt to answer it.  It will help you learn!
- Send me a private message on Slack (@chester)
- Discuss your problems with the tutors in person
- Last resort, send the tutors a private message on Slack

&lt;/div&gt;

---

## Easy classes are worthless classes

- You won't retain any of the material covered
--

- You or someone else pays good money for you to get a good education here
--

- I want to do everything in my power to help you learn this material as I see it as THE MOST IMPORTANT class you can take as an undergraduate.
--

- You have many misconceptions about how you learn best.  That's not your fault, but habits must be broken.
--

- Can we build muscles sitting on the couch?

---

## Why are you learning R?

- ~~Because I enjoy partaking in [Schadenfreude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schadenfreude)~~

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img src="figure/google_scholar.png" width="567" /&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

---

## Why are you learning R?

- R is free, R improves, R has existed for 40+ years
- You can show what you have learned to a potential employer easily
- I want to prepare you for the real world as best as I can and make you more employable than your competitors

---

## Why are you learning R?

- R will save you TONS of time in the long run. Long term thinking is key.
    - You can easily tweak your code if you need to do another analysis
    - Remembering what drop-down menu some thing is in two years from now in a different program will be hard
