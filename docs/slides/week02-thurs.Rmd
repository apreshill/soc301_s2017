## Beginning steps

Frequently the first thing you should do when given a dataset is to

- check that the data is **tidy**,
- identify the observation unit,
- specify the variables, and
- give the types of variables you are presented with.

This will help you with 

- choosing the appropriate plot, 
- summarizing the data, and 
- understanding which inferences can be applied.

## What is Tidy Data?

1. Each variable forms a column.
2. Each observation forms a row.
3. Each type of observational unit forms a table.

The third point means we don't mix apples and oranges, keep apples together with apples.


## What is Tidy Data?

1. Each observation forms a row. In other words, each row corresponds to a single **observational unit**
1. Each variable forms a column:
    + Some of the variables may be used to identify the **observational units**. For organizational purposes, it's generally better to put these in the left-hand columns
    + Some of the variables may be **observed values** associated with each observational unit
1. Each type of observational unit forms a table.



## What is Tidy Data?

This is just a spreadsheet! 

But we are very strict about the previous three rules.



## [nycflights13 Package](http://github.com/hadley/nycflights13)

- Loaded via `library(nycflights13)` 

- Contains
information about all flights that departed from NYC (e.g. EWR, JFK and LGA) in
2013: 336,776 flights in total. 

- To help understand what causes delays, it also
includes a number of other useful datasets:

    * `weather`: hourly meterological data for each airport
    * `planes`: construction information about each plane
    * `airports`: airport names and locations
    * `airlines`: translation between two letter carrier codes and names

All of these data frames are available for viewing [here](https://ismayc.github.io/Effective-Data-Storytelling-using-the-tidyverse/moderndive.html).

## Minute Paper

(Half sheet of paper is fine.  Share with your neighbor.)

- What are the three characteristics of tidy data?
- Draw the DATA diagram that was presented on the board every day we have met as a class so far.
