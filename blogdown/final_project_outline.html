<h2>Learning Goals</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Have students engage in the data/science research pipeline in as faithful a manner as possible while maintaining a level suitable for novices</em></p>
<p><img src="../pipeline4.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 600px;"/></p></li>
<li><p><em>Contribute to the R community by developing a vignette for others to learn from on a <code>fivethirtyeight</code> R package data set using <code>ggplot2</code> and <code>dplyr</code></em></p></li>
<li><p><em>Design a data journalism piece focused on effective data storytelling ideas from class</em></p></li>
</ul>
<div id="format" class="section level4">
<h4>Format</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Your final project will center around writing a data journalism article that acts as both a vignette for the <code>fivethirtyeight</code> R package and is in the style of quality data journalism. You should focus on merging these two types when you write your group project.</p>
<ul>
<li>Examples of such types of journalism can be found on:
<ul>
<li><a href = "http://fivethirtyeight.com/" target = "_blank">FiveThirtyEight</a></li>
<li>The New York Times’ <a href = "http://www.nytimes.com/section/upshot" target = "_blank">The Upshot</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Examples of vignettes can be found at
<ul>
<li><a href = "http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/rudeboybert/fivethirtyeight/blob/master/vignettes/NBA.html" target = "_blank">2015 NBA player predictions analysis using the <code>tidyverse</code></a></li>
<li><a href = "https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/fivethirtyeight/vignettes/bechdel.html" target = "_blank">Bechdel analysis using the <code>tidyverse</code></a></li>
<li><a href = "http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/rudeboybert/fivethirtyeight/blob/master/vignettes/trump_twitter.html" target = "_blank">Trump Twitter analysis using the <code>tidyverse</code></a></li>
<li><a href = "http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/rudeboybert/fivethirtyeight/blob/master/vignettes/comics_gender.html" target = "_blank">Gender in Comic Books</a></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>You must flex your statistical and data science muscles you’ve built so far this semester. In particular:
<ul>
<li>Data visualization using <code>ggplot2</code></li>
<li>Data manipulating/wrangling using <code>dplyr</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>You will need to include AT LEAST two publication quality graphics produced using <code>ggplot2</code>.</li>
<li>Your project also needs to include AT LEAST one instance of using <code>dplyr</code> to create a summary table to be displayed directly or for use in creating a graphic using <code>ggplot2</code>.</li>
<li>When you are writing the vignette, you should be thinking about explaining ideas to someone that has little to know statistical background. The best articles/vignettes are ones that captivate a broad audience.<br />
</li>
<li>You should carefully convey what the point of your article is throughout your vignette. You should think about the following as you work as a team.
<ul>
<li>Why is this important for others to know?</li>
<li>What might someone be confused about as they read this?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Administrative Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Submission Format</strong>: Each group must create a single RStudio project that is shared amongst the group members and with Chester. In the same folder as the RStudio project, you will include an R Markdown file containing all R code needed and the text of your vignette as well as a knitted HTML document that shows your analysis and writing. You’ll be putting all of your documents into a Google Drive folder on Chester’s account and your specific link will be shared with you after you have decided on groups. All your work will be centrally located here; do not email me any files. In the shared Google Drive folder will be a file called <code>final_project.Rmd</code>. This is where you will put your final analysis. You are encouraged to also create R script files to show your work as needed.</li>
<li><strong>Project Proposal</strong>: Submit by the beginning of class on Tuesday, March 7
<ul>
<li>Identify as soon as possible who the three members of your group will be. Send me a message on Slack when you have identified who you’d like to work with.</li>
<li>You should identify what are the top three data sets you’d be interested in analyzing.</li>
<li>Identify at least two questions you’d like to answer for each data set
<ul>
<li>This should include what variables you will use, what types they are, and which of the 5NG would be appropriate for assisting in answering these questions.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Group Project Draft</strong>: Due at the beginning of class on Tuesday, March 14
<ul>
<li>This should be a nearly complete version of your project. All typos should be fixed and it should include all of the requirements of the project. <strong>Failure to have this completed will likely result in a failing grade for the Group Project.</strong> This means that your work should be entirely done so that I can review it and provide some comments on style that you can fix relatively quickly.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Electronic-Only Final Project Submission</strong>: Due Thursday, March 23 at 10 AM
<ul>
<li>In the shared folder on Google Drive:
<ul>
<li>A <code>final_project.Rmd</code> file that completely reproduces your analysis. I should have to press Knit only once to recreate the entire HTML page.</li>
<li>All necessary data files (saved as CSV files) if you needed to join with other data set(s).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Individually: A Google Forms survey to ensure all members of the group were active members of completing the group project. <strong>You will not receive a passing grade for the Group Project on an individual basis if you were not a good and supportive team member.</strong> I will include a link to this on Slack on or before Wednesday, March 22.</li>
<li>Your project won’t be considered submitted until I give you Slack confirmation that everything looks good.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Honor Code</strong>: This is the equivalent of an academic term paper; all honor code rules about plagarism and citations apply.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="electronic-only-final-project-submission" class="section level2">
<h2>Electronic-Only Final Project Submission</h2>
<p>Roughly speaking, your final project submission will have two major components:</p>
<ul>
<li>The actual journalism article. As to knowing the guidelines (length, format, tone), just ask yourself: “What does a newspaper/online news story sound like?”</li>
<li>A supplementary materials section that goes more in depth about the nitty-gritty details, that one might want to spare casual readers from, but include for people wanting to learn more.</li>
<li>A <code>final_project.Rmd</code> template file is available <a href="http://ismayc.github.io/teaching/soc301-f2016/slides/week-12/Final_Project.Rmd">here</a>. Please download this file to your computer and then Upload it to <a href="http://beta.rstudio.org">the RStudio Server</a>.</li>
</ul>
